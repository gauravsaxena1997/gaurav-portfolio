Since your ideation is not good, I created a blueprint of what I want. Here is the list of the elements ui, ux and all over y that I want.
What I want that you analyze the whole plan with full focus Where I mentioned references and site you actually scroll the website crawl it or Whatever method you want See what actually I am Telling you it will be critical when we are actually designing since Many of the section inspired by some other portfolio designs or websites
I want this to be two phases. First, you analyze the whole plan that I am giving to you and just telling me in very short summary, like how you like the idea, it is visible or not. What do you think we need building this, like what libraries or all the illustration you're talking about, how do you handle it your own, what will be in the timeline for it, things like that in a very short and sweet way. And then phase two, you will be creating a MD file. Basically, it will be an enhanced version of the data I am providing because it is just dumping my ideas into one sheet, but you will be adding that in a very formatted and clean way.
Theme: For theme i like to start with the dark theme with white or very light font on top of it large font many betta clean layout all over. this will be the default and we will also add a theme toggler where user can switch to light mode and all the things will be opposite we will have a very light background with dark fonts on top of it that majorly contrast like when we are on the white we use dark colors like black gray with color of our choosing like I think currently we have orange so let's try with giving some shades with orange on the dark font and similarly on the opposite

Responsiveness: We will start by creating sections by sections and we have to make sure that what we are building it is looking good on all of the screen sizes, screen types, either it is a very small phone or iPhone mini or it is a large phone like Samsung Galaxy Ultra or it is a flip or fold phone with maximum width, minimum height or minimum width, maximum height then on a tablet and most importantly the desktop of any size and in the range we are operating like for example for desktop sizes of 13 inch to big size TVs like 48 inches make sure we are using the utilities with responsive classes like clamp utilities for width, height, spacing All of that, we are not hard-coding anything like pixels, etc. We are using responsive measures, percentage or any responsive utils that will make the theme look alike in every type of screen size. Like my major test would be like a 13-inch MacBook and a 28-inch screen desktop than a a 65-inch TV. I will be testing all of this and on mobile also with the help of Google Chrome inspection, I will be testing in all the screen sizes. So please make sure that is our top priority.


Animations/Effects: For this, I'm planning a very, very creative portfolio, since currently I am seeing a variety of animations, starting with like scroll animations, that is not scroll vertically only, like scroll randomly, like when we scroll down, actually the screen scrolls horizontally, then with the angle slightly, then vertical, so effects like that, also clicking or dragging effects or hovering effects, we'll be using very creative ideas in that, I will be providing you the suggestions or my thoughts and you will be picturing it into real life, in the real time.

SEO/Performance: Whatever we are building, I will not remind you again and again that we have to Prioritize SEO since the goal of this portfolio is to reach maximum audience, my target audience, clients, etc. So make sure we are Doing a top class SEO like what SEMrush, etc. are doing with their analysis we have to build all kind of schemas, files that are responsible for SEO and And You already know like what are my skills, UI, UX, full stack, SEO performance, etc. so we will be highlighting that and Keeping all the measures and making the website fully SEO optimized. In performance also like I know that you mentioned that we don't have to use any 3D assets or strong animations, but since I have to use that and we cannot neglect that. So I have to use that. But keeping that in mind, we have to make sure that the performance is good as much as we can, we can optimize what's in our hand. If not already, let's add the lighthouse module and whenever we are doing or finishing any particular section like hero section or a particular skill section, etc, then we do analysis both SEO wise and performance wise to keep things in check.

Content Creation: For content creation, I want to clear one thing that we have to use the taglines or text that will be very specific to me, like the tagline that we currently use, web app that drive result, it is absolutely like not that much generic, but since everyone is using AI to create their portfolios, so everyone is having a similar kind of taglines, I want to differentiate with other freelancers or other developers that are doing the same thing. So I want to add more specific things and unique packaging style so I can present myself differently and uniquely to my target audience.

Linting and Errors: We have to make sure with each respawn that we don't have any linting issues, any bugs, any build errors, etc.

Custom Scroll bar: For the scrollbar, I have one creative idea also. Check out this website for reference "http://robinmastromarino.com/project/seeds-of-dreams" if you see, we don't have the native browser level or OS level scrollbar that is completely removed. Instead of that, what we have that a sleek scrollbar on the right-hand side, which acts as a progress bar. So when we scroll, instead of the normal behavior, it progresses as a progress bar. So when we reach 50%, it completes 50%. And when we are 100%, then this scrollbar shows 100% of the progress completed. So I want similar kind of progress bar, obviously matching with the theme, like for dark, light scrollbar, and vice versa. But we have to be very careful about the scrolling, what is happening, since we are planning for a very creative scroll, for some example when we scroll vertically, in reality on the UI is scrolling horizontally and for some it is an angled scroll, for some it is vertical so by some logic or by some technique we have to figure out like what is the actual progress of the site that is being scrolled, since by height of the website we cannot determine the actual scrolling, so be prepared for that. And the primary scroll within the section would be horizontal only And as I mentioned The scroll bar that we are thinking of in this case also it will be Providing info like how much we scrolled and complete the all over exploration of this portfolio

Ingored sections for now in this theme: some section we will add later on and we don't have to plan now one is blog and second is skills


Rough Idea:
So now I will be providing you what's in my mind and you can suggest like is that cool how much efforts that will take or what tools you will have to use etc.

Hero Section: 
So for hero section, my idea is that we will keep it as minimal as we can. Text wise, as I already mentioned, I want large fonts and minimal things as much as we can. Only the thing that is absolutely required. So we add something there like currently we added a tagline that I build a web app that drive results, but it also become very generic since everybody is using AI and everybody s using like this. So we have to be more specific and Not be generic, so we have to package ourselves different and we have to make sure that we provide a clear picture that why the client hire me, how I am different from other freelancers and what are the unique things.
As I mentioned for Inception, we have a cool effect. So for hero section, I'm planning this. Basically, the idea is to add a lighthouse effect. So we will have an illustration or graphic of a subtle lighthouse that is matching with the theme. Not has too much detail, just some graphics there which represent the lighthouse. Then initially when user lands, they do not have any mouse pointer on the hero section, it will behave simply. But as soon as user has a pointer on a screen, so imagine that the lighthouse light is following the mouse pointer, like similarly what we have in Googly eye animation. So when we follow our pointer, the eye follows the mouse pointer. Similarly like that, When user hovers over the section, the angled lighthouse light, which will supposedly be in an angle like 30 degree or 35 degree, please check on the internet what is the ideal angle is so particularly that light follows the pointer. For the highlight effect and horror effect, use this site as reference which I find very good.
https://www.michalgrzebisz.com/
So basically it has a pure dark background and the text initially visible as white and yellow, which is a contrast of the dark black background, which is really good. But as soon as I hover over the text, the background adds a circle, a yellow circle in the background, and the text also changes from light to dark, like dark blue or black. So I am planning like similar effect for the lighthouse. So initially we have a dark background and whatever the light colors we are planning, but as soon as we are hovering, the light of the lighthouse follows the mouse pointer and change the background from light to dark and the text quite the opposite. In the light and dark theme, we have to be extra careful about the colors and contrast that we are doing for light and dark theme. Also, we have to plan for like in small size screens, what this animation will look like, because in mobile, we generally don't have any hover effects. So plan that as well.

Hero to Stats scroll: horizontal

Quick Stats:
since the hero section will not have much details about me so this section would be a like similar section to about me where we quickly had some stats about me. And this is kind of a proposal like what, how, why clients have to hire me and what are my strengths etc. So here I want to mention these quick things.
1. First thing is utilizing the AI. Since now there is AI everywhere and everyone is using AI I want to show that I am also using AI in every possible UI, UX, development, SEO, etc and what are the results that is driven by that For example, faster delivery, testing and thinking some of yourself So basically it tells me like what I use, how I use and what are the results
2. Second is obviously the experience I want to show that I have a 5 plus year of corporate in both product based companies and service based companies serving thousands of users with a different requirement and now I am providing services directly to the client with my knowledge and the power of AI combining. You should follow the above step like what it is, why it is, and what are the results of this. And also I am mentioning that I have one year plus experience now with freelancing.
3. Third will be the timing. I am highly adaptable across global time zones like US, UK, Europe, India, etc. For a reference, there is a website that I took the inspiration from. https://parthsharma.me/ basically it shows three options USA, India, UK and on clicking one of them it will point the globe that is beneath it to the exact thing that we clicked. But I don't want this click I just I want that to be just that kind of a globe or something and that Will be rotating on itself Maybe we can add some interactivity. So user can spin it like a fidget spinner following the gravity and physics rule
Animation and theme: 
- so for this steps what I have in my mind that we are scrolling horizontal course continuing with the transition from hero to quick steps and basically all the section sticking 50% of the width and 100% of the height so on top we are adding the stats and on below we are adding some kind of interactive 3d animation that user can interact with or play with So, for the time zone adaptability, I already mentioned a globe effect.
- for AI, you can suggest like what could be the 3D animation that we could be using that is, that have like magnetic effect and also interactive. 
- For the typical experience I for corporate and freelancing I am thinking about a laptop animation. Here is the site for the reference I really like for this laptop animation. "https://masontywong.com/" It has a very good 3D effect and magnetic effect, when we hovering our pointer it is reacting with it and adding a magnetic effect. So for interactivity we can add like keyboard also in this laptop and when we click we will add a certain animation like click or a light on the particular keystroke to be highlighted like it is actually typing.
- so in general this whole section follows the same horizontal scroll so in reality user is scrolling vertically so they start from the hero section and scroll vertically but in reality it will be scrolled horizontally and we start with the quick stat section first we will show this AI on the like 50% of the width then user keep scrolling and with the scroll effect they will see the second step which will be the experience and then again the third which will be the time zone one
- The all three elements will have the same vibe with different content and Illustrations Stats the format I specified a court. It is why that what is the result for it? Just a suggestion from me you can improvise it and below we will have a 3d graphic Illustration With the magnetic effect and interactive effect on them Maybe you can toggle the text and Illustration on the second stat. So first we will see text on top and below it of it We will see the illustration, then on the second instead we will see  the illustration on top and below it the text and then finally the opposite of it

Stats to Project scroll:For that, to scroll, I will be needing an animation that kind of looks like a hypotenuse in the Pythagoras theorem. So when we scroll, we will not scroll horizontally or vertically. The text will go from bottom right to top left, and the next section will appear in the same way, like from bottom right to top left.

Projects: 
- So, in project level, when we score initially we will land to our first project.
- Like initially, the page when we landed on it, So it will have a two column, in first column on top we will have the title of the project and the count like 01 on the top, then on the bottom, we will have the about section and quick highlights for that.
- and on the second column we will have the either the video of the project that we have and if we do not have we will have the hero image as a fallback, On the project video, please add a frame as well for example a tablet so it looks good
- and it only consists of the half of the information we still have some information left so now user scroll and this time we scroll vertically only how it's supposed to be and user will land on another full width and height page where the project number and the project title we have on the previous screen will exactly remain on the same place as previous but below of it on the first column we will have the details left of the project it will depend on the type that we have we have different sections so according to that we will show on the first column and in this screen on the second column we will have the screenshots
- For the screenshots. I am planning of adding another creative script animation, so check this site for the reference where we have the project details. "https://remyjouni.dev/". So when we scroll down, the screenshot shows on a stacking position and when we scroll up, we will have a 3D effect like the distance between each screenshot is rising and we will be able to see each screenshot fully as we scroll, similar to this kind of effect on our screenshots.
- and then we scroll and another project will kick in it will replace a sticky heading that we have like the count and the project name and again we will follow the same animation like about and key highlights and then hero video or image is a frame then we scroll again the sticky project count and name will stay there details on the left will change and on right we will again have the screenshot with this stacking up 3d animation that I described
- and within the project also while we scroll we will have a vertical scroll only so in this whole section either we are transitioning enter project or one project to another we will have a scroll which is vertical only

Project to Services scroll: horizontal scroll

Services:
- for services, the whole scroll is will be vertical. The reason behind that is the animation is fluid animation that we are trying to achieve. Please check this website "https://pixel2html.netlify.app/" On the whole website, you see in a seamless scroll effect. So when I'm on the hero section, when I scroll, I see that a page is going below the laptop when I'm scrolling down. It changing to Photoshop, then it goes behind the section, and when it comes out, it is a different illustration like a document. Then when we scroll, it's changed to a coding kind of illustration. Then finally, when we scroll down, it's seen as a website on a screen. This is the section I am most excited about, and I want to see like how you ideate or visualize this. So basically, for this, we will add kind of a storytelling, like a step like what I do. 
- And in this storytelling, we will tell the audience. that all are the services we provide. So we can start with like the MVP generation where we will mention like ideation, proof of concept, build, then demos, and as soon as we are building on a cool scroll animation, we will add a corresponding animation like a dog or something. Then when we scroll, then we will do the UI, UX and appropriate illustration change like Figma screen. Then we scroll down and we will show the development. And I think currently we are doing web development and backend separately. Let's do it combinedly. We are mentioned like we will handle front-end, backend, API, etc. Then it scrolls more below and we will show integrations. For example, payment gateways, authentication, email services, etc. and corresponding illustration that will be changing and continuing with the whole scroll animation. And then we scroll further and it will be changed to SEO, performance. You get the idea, right?  And let's remove things like SaaS development and e-commerce development since it is not particularly services, it is the product that we build through our services. So that's why this does not belong to the services section. So plan accordingly.
- scroll within: For the scroll I already mentioned that we will have the sequential vertical scrolling in this section with the seamless scroll animation changing one element to other where we have services and it will be transitioning according to what we show where it has been showing it is a question like do we use two column here also like in first column we will add the service and the second column we will add the illustration and when we keep scrolling we will change the illustration with the full scrolling effect and on the left hand side the stat or whatever service we are using change also or I am open to other layouts as well since we already used two columns in the project section.

Services to Contact scroll: horizontal scroll

Contact: 
- another one cool and creative one I am planning check the reference for this "https://robbowen.digital/" So basically in the hero section you'll see an illustration of a person, it is in 2D only. And when I hover my pointer around the screen, it is an enhanced version of the googly eyes. But in this case, the person's whole facial expression including eyes, eyebrows, neck movement, all over face movement change and following my mouse pointer. so for contact us we can use that so we will have this kind of illustration on either side left or right and on the opposite side we will have the contact form and the schedule call button and the creativity in this would be like it will detect how close I am towards the form if I go closer the facial expression change to a more happy person and when I go far from the form of the contact us section it will be kind of more neutral or sad facial expression with eye following and eyebrows etc. neck movement following my mouse pointers

Contact to Credits scroll: horizontal scroll

Credits/Inpirations: 
- This will be a section where I want to mention all the links and portfolio that I am referring to that I use for the inspiration. So it will be a fair trade, the references, inspiration I will be using, I want to mention it at the last. I didn't think of UI or any animation for that. It will be very simple page, maybe we can think of it later on.

I think that's it that's my whole vision and now it's your turn to analyze the whole thing the last time and I told you it was not this plant so you did not did a great job but I want that this time you analyze it very carefully and your thoughts it is visible or not anything you want to change replace etc and what I mentioned above please check the references very carefully for all the website if needed or whatever method you like and let's start with phase 1 only where you tell me a very short and concise summary of your thoughts suggestions tools we will be using  etc
